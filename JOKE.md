# PyTorch Programmer Jokes

## 1. Tensor Troubles
Why don't PyTorch tensors ever get lost? 
Because they always know their dimensions!

## 2. Gradient Descent Dating
I tried to use gradient descent to find the perfect date, but I kept getting stuck in local minima.

## 3. Neural Network Nutrition
How many neural networks does it take to make breakfast?
Just one, but it needs 10,000 examples of toast before it stops burning it.

## 4. Backpropagation Blues
My neural network and I have a lot in common. We both learn from our mistakes through backpropagation, but we still make the same errors repeatedly.

## 5. GPU Woes
I would tell you a joke about CUDA, but it's only funny if you have the right drivers.

## 6. Overfitting Fashion
I trained my model on my wardrobe, and now it thinks everyone should wear sweatpants to formal events. Talk about overfitting!

## 7. Activation Function
Why did the ReLU function go to therapy?
It was struggling to stay positive when faced with negative input.

## 8. Deep Learning Diet
I put my diet plan through a deep learning algorithm. It recommended I eat more bytes.

## 9. PyTorch vs TensorFlow
How do you know someone uses PyTorch instead of TensorFlow?
Don't worry, they'll tell you... eagerly!

## 10. Batch Normalization
Why was the neural network always so calm during training?
It practiced batch normalization!
