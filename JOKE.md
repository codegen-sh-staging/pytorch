# PyTorch Jokes

Here are 10 of the funniest jokes for PyTorch enthusiasts:

## 1. Tensor Troubles
Why don't tensors ever get lost? 
Because they always know their dimensions!

## 2. GPU Upgrade
I told my wife I needed a new GPU for deep learning.
She said, "We can't afford it."
I said, "This marriage isn't working... in parallel."

## 3. Neural Network Dating
Why did the neural network break up with the gradient descent algorithm?
It said the relationship wasn't converging to anything meaningful.

## 4. PyTorch vs TensorFlow
How many TensorFlow developers does it take to change a lightbulb?
None, they're still trying to figure out why PyTorch's implementation is more intuitive.

## 5. Overfitting
My machine learning model is like my dating life - constantly overfitting to the training data and failing miserably in production.

## 6. Deep Learning Diet
I started a deep learning diet where I reduce my loss function daily.
So far I've only optimized my path to the refrigerator.

## 7. Backward Pass
Why was the backpropagation algorithm feeling nostalgic?
Because it was always looking back at where it came from.

## 8. Activation Function
What's an activation function's favorite movie?
"ReLU-ctant Heroes"

## 9. Batch Normalization
Why did the neural network go to therapy?
It had trouble normalizing its batches of emotions.

## 10. PyTorch Pick-up Line
Are you a PyTorch tensor? Because you've got the perfect dimensions and you're running through my mind in parallel.
